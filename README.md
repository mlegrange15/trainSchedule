# trainSchedule

This project is a simple train scheduler. The user can submit a form with details on the train such as train name, destinantion, first train time and frequency of the trains. On submition of the form a table will update the details and calculate next arrival time and the minutes until the next train arrives.

The project is a useful way to showcase the use of forms, dynamic tables, firbase and moment.js.

All a user has to do is fill out the form and click submit.
